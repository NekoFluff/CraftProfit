# CraftProfit

Start crafting profits on *Black Desert Online* with this tool!

### If you're interested in helping with this project, send me an email at alexnou@gmail.com

This is a small project for automatically calculating profit values for crafting items and selling them on the *Black Desert Online* market. Since the crafting tree is extensive and there are multiple ways of crafting an individual item, four csv files are created to list out the potential profit values for some of the various crafting methods (`market_craft_profit_values.csv, hand_craft_profit_values.csv, optimal_profit_values.csv, and optimal_per_sec_profit_values.csv`) and stored in the local *Profit* folder. Additional recipes can be added in the *Recipe* folder. Cooking and alchemy time reduction buffs are implemented and in the *Buffs* folder.

The most important is **optimal_per_sec_profit_values.csv** since it provides the best profit values that can be generated per second. This involves buying certain pieces of the recipe (if they're cheap) and crafting others (if they're expensive). The details of each csv file are listed in their own subsection below.

## HOW TO USE

Run `python ./ItemMarketPriceUpdater.py</code>` to generate market_prices.json in the Market_Prices folder.

Run `python ./Main.py` to generate the profit csv files.

Type in the item you want to craft.

Type in the number of items you want to craft.

**(All outputed instructions are based on the optimal_per_sec_profit_values.csv for maximum profits)**

## market_craft_profit_values.csv:

Buy all necessary items from the market and craft it.

## hand_craft_profit_values.csv:

## optimal_profit_values.csv:

Optimize the total amount of money made for an item (No matter how long it takes).

## optimal_per_sec_profit_values.csv:

(Time is money. Sometimes buying it from the market will cost more, but it takes too long to craft by hand with minimal gain.)

# Adding a Recipe
First take a look at a sample recipe
```
{
    "Action": "Cooking",
    "Last Updated": "2019-09-07 19:13:08.812676",
    "Name": "Beer",
    "Quantity Produced": 2.66,
    "Recipes": [
        {
            "Leavening Agent": 2,
            "Mineral Water": 6,
            "Sugar": 1,
            "Wheat": 5
        }
    ],
    "Time to Produce": 10.0
}
```

You can copy/paste the content to a new json file in the Recipes folder and change the values accordingly. Just make sure all items used in the Recipes list are also json files too. 

# Recipes with Symbolic Item Recipes

Cooking recipes generally allows multiple items as a substitute for an ingredient (e.g. Dough). The Aloe Cookie recipe is an example that uses the symbolic item 'Dough' which encompasses all 7 types of dough. Feel free to create more symbolic items!
